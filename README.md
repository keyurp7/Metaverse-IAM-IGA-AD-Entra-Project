# Metaverse IAM Lab

**Enterprise Identity Governance & Hybrid Identity Environment**

A production-inspired Identity and Access Management environment built to demonstrate enterprise-grade capability across IAM systems architecture, identity governance engineering, access automation, platform support, and operational troubleshooting.

## 🛠 Stack

| Technology | Role |
|---|---|
| **Active Directory** | On-prem source of truth |
| **SailPoint IdentityIQ** | Identity governance platform |
| **Microsoft Entra ID** | Cloud identity layer |
| **AD Connect / Entra Connect** | Hybrid identity sync |
| **Java & Apache Tomcat** | IIQ server runtime |

## 📖 Overview

This lab was built to reflect real enterprise IAM processes, not just product setup. It covers:

- Source-of-truth driven identity governance
- Joiner, Mover, and Leaver automation
- Role-based access control and business role design
- Workgroup ownership and access accountability
- Hybrid identity sync from AD to Entra ID
- Server runtime validation and connector support
- Troubleshooting across LDAP, LDAPS, certificates, Tomcat, and platform behaviour
- End-to-end access request and provisioning validation

---

## 🏗 Architecture

### Architecture Diagram

<img width="2392" height="742" alt="Metaverse IAM Architecture diagram" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2c830ea-c202-482c-9888-aa04db055b92" />

### On-Prem Identity Source
- Active Directory hosted on Windows Server VMs
- OU structure for users, workstations, helpdesk, and governed identity containers
- Identity attributes such as `department` and `employeeType` used in governance logic

### Identity Governance Layer
- SailPoint IdentityIQ hosted on a dedicated VM
- Java and Apache Tomcat installed locally on the IIQ server
- AD onboarding, aggregation, identity mapping, provisioning, lifecycle events, workgroups, and role design

### Hybrid Identity Layer
- AD Connect / Microsoft Entra Connect hosted on a dedicated VM
- Sync from on-prem AD into Microsoft Entra ID via AD Connect

### Cloud Identity Layer
- Microsoft Entra ID for synced users, groups, and cloud identity visibility

---

## 🔑 Key Areas

### Identity Governance
- AD as source of truth
- Identity mapping in SailPoint IIQ
- AD connector configuration and provisioning integration
- Entitlement and role visibility
- Workgroup ownership and governance accountability

### JML Automation
- Joiner, Mover, and Leaver lifecycle events
- Business process workflow design for JML
- Attribute-driven access logic using `department` and `employeeType`
- Birthright and role-based provisioning

### Access Governance
- Business roles aligned to departments
- Birthright-style access design
- Delegated governance through workgroups and ownership
- Controlled access request and provisioning process

### Hybrid Identity
- On-prem AD sync into Entra ID through AD Connect
- Synced users and groups visible in Microsoft Entra ID
- Entra Connect health validation and sync troubleshooting

### Platform Support & Troubleshooting
- LDAP and LDAPS validation
- Certificate and Java truststore troubleshooting
- SailPoint connector debugging
- Tomcat runtime and application hosting validation
- HTTP 405 platform issue investigation
- Final validation through successful task execution and provisioning results

---

## ✅ End-to-End Validation

A full governed access flow was validated for a test identity:

1. Access request initiated in SailPoint IdentityIQ
2. Business role selection and submission
3. Request approval and provisioning completion
4. Provisioning engine execution
5. AD group membership updated after provisioning

> For detailed validation evidence, see [docs/validation.md](docs/validation.md).
