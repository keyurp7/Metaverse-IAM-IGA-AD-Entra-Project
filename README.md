# Metaverse-IAM-IGA-AD-Entra

The Metaverse IAM Lab is a production-inspired Identity and Access Management environment built to demonstrate enterprise-grade capability across IAM systems architecture, identity governance engineering, access automation, platform support, and operational troubleshooting.

# Stack

- *Active Directory** as the on-prem source of truth
- *SailPoint IdentityIQ** as the identity governance platform
- *Microsoft Entra ID** as the cloud identity layer
- *AD Connect / Microsoft Entra Connect** for hybrid identity sync
- *Java and Apache Tomcat** installed locally on the IIQ server

# Overview

This lab was built to reflect real enterprise IAM processes, not just product setup. It covers:

- source-of-truth driven identity governance
- joiner, mover, and leaver automation
- role-based access control and business role design
- workgroup ownership and access accountability
- hybrid identity sync from AD to Entra ID
- server runtime validation and connector support
- troubleshooting across LDAP, LDAPS, certificates, Tomcat, and platform behavior
- end-to-end access request and provisioning validation

# Architecture

# On-Prem Identity Source

- Active Directory hosted on Windows Server VMs
- OU structure for users, workstations, helpdesk, and governed identity containers
- identity attributes such as department and employeeType used in governance logic

# Identity Governance Layer
- SailPoint IdentityIQ hosted on a dedicated VM
- Java and Apache Tomcat installed locally on the IIQ server
- AD onboarding, aggregation, identity mapping, provisioning, lifecycle events, workgroups, and role design

# Hybrid Identity Layer
- AD Connect / Microsoft Entra Connect hosted on a dedicated VM
- sync from on-prem AD into Microsoft Entra ID via AD Connect

# Cloud Identity Layer
- Microsoft Entra ID for synced users, groups, and cloud identity visibility

# Key Areas

# Identity Governance
- AD as source of truth
- identity mapping in SailPoint IIQ
- AD connector configuration and provisioning integration
- entitlement and role visibility
- workgroup ownership and governance accountability

# JML Automation
- Joiner, Mover, and Leaver lifecycle events
- business process workflow design for JML
- attribute-driven access logic using department and employeeType
- birthright and role-based provisioning

# Access Governance
- business roles aligned to departments
- birthright-style access design
- delegated governance through workgroups and ownership
- controlled access request and provisioning process

# Hybrid Identity
- on-prem AD sync into Entra ID through AD Connect
- synced users and groups visible in Microsoft Entra ID
- Entra Connect health validation and sync troubleshooting

# Platform Support and Troubleshooting
- LDAP and LDAPS validation
- certificate and Java truststore troubleshooting
- SailPoint connector debugging
- Tomcat runtime and application hosting validation
- HTTP 405 platform issue investigation
- final validation through successful task execution and provisioning results

# End-to-End Validation

A full governed access flow was validated for a test identity:

1. access request initiated in SailPoint IdentityIQ
2. business role selection and submission
3. request approval and provisioning completion
4. provisioning engine execution
5. AD group membership updated after provisioning
